# Get to know Dataset in Parquet Files

 ## [H2O LLM Studio](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-llmstudio)

* A framework and no-code GUI designed for fine-tuning state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs).

* I found two files, `train.pq` and `train_full.pq`, when I selected the Datasets function and chose the View Datasets option.

### Parquet vs CSV

* The choice between Parquet and CSV is contingent on the specific requirements, use cases, and the tools or frameworks used for data processing and analysis.

|Key Factors|Parquet|CSV|
|-|-|-|
|Storage Efficiency|**columnar storage layout offers superior storage efficiency due to its advanced encoding schemes and compression techniques, significantly reducing the storage footprint**|traditional row-based format|
|Performance|**selectively reads relevant data for analytical queries, skipping the rest, which leads to a substantial increase in processing speed**|necessitate the reading of entire rows, even when only a subset of columns is required|
|Data Types and Schema Evolution|It's adept at handling complex and nested data structures, making it ideal for structured and semi-structured data. It also supports schema evolution, facilitating the addition of new columns to existing Parquet files without necessitating a complete dataset rewrite.|It's limited to a flat, tabular format and lacks built-in support for complex data types or schema evolution.|
|Interoperability|Not directly readable by humans, are compatible with a plethora of data processing frameworks and tools that support the Parquet format, such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Apache Arrow.|**CSV files are universally compatible and can be easily manipulated using standard text editors or spreadsheet software.**|
|Serialization and Data Compression|**column-level compression techniques which significantly reduces file sizes and enhancing I/O performance**|**However, the compression and serialization overhead may be lower for CSV compared to Parquet.**|
|Schema Flexibility|Parquet benefits from a defined schema, ensuring data consistency and enabling more efficient compression and query optimization.|It does not enforce a strict schema, providing flexibility in terms of column quantity and types.|
|Column Pruning|Columnar format allows for column pruning, a significant performance enhancement that isn't possible with row-based formats like CSV.||
|Popularity|Parquet has gained substantial traction outside the Hadoop ecosystem, with projects like Delta Lake being built on Parquet files. While Avro is popular within the Hadoop ecosystem, it lacks built-in readers in Spark and Pandas.||
|Schema Storage|Parquet stores the file schema in the file metadata, eliminating the need for supplying or inferring the schema, which can be tedious or error-prone.||
|Column Metadata|Parquet stores metadata statistics for each column and allows users to add their own column metadata. This feature enables Parquet predicate pushdown filtering, which is supported by Dask & Spark cluster computing frameworks.||
|Complex Column Types|Parquet supports complex column types like arrays, dictionaries, and nested schemas, which cannot be reliably stored in simple file formats like CSV.||
|Immutability|Parquet files are immutable This characteristic means that while it's easy to add a row to a CSV file, it's not as straightforward with a Parquet file.||
|Data Lakes|In a big data environment, optimal disk layout of data is crucial. Parquet's ability to work with hundreds or thousands of files, disk partitioning, and compacting small files makes it an ideal choice for data lakes.||
|Conclusion|**Parquet is typically favored when dealing with large datasets, analytical workloads, and complex data types, as it provides superior storage efficiency and query performance.**|CSV files are typically used for simpler tabular data, data interchange, and scenarios where human readability and ease of use are paramount.|

|Encoding methods|Parquet data can be compressed|
|-|-|
|Dictionary encoding|This is enabled automatically and dynamically for data with a small number of unique values.|
|Bit packing|Storage of integers is usually done with dedicated 32 or 64 bits per integer. This allows more efficient storage of small integers.|
|Run length encoding (RLE)|When the same value occurs multiple times, a single value is stored once along with the number of occurrences. Parquet implements a combined version of bit packing and RLE, in which the encoding switches based on which produces the best compression results.|

### Python code to view Parquet and CSV Files

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file
df_csv = pd.read_csv('__meta_info__train.pq.csv')

# Display the contents
print(df_csv)

# Read the CSV file
df_csv = pd.read_csv('__meta_info__train_full.pq.csv')

# Display the contents
print(df_csv)

# Read the Parquet file
df_parquet = pd.read_parquet('train.pq')

# Display the contents
print(df_parquet)

# Read the Parquet file
df_parquet = pd.read_parquet('train_full.pq')

# Display the contents
print(df_parquet)
```

### Understanding and Viewing Training Data for DPO and Causal Language Modeling in LLM Fine-Tuning

|DPO Modeling (Distillation for Preference Optimization)|Causal Language Modeling|
|-|-|
|DPO is a training technique often used to fine-tune models based on user preferences or predefined criteria. In the context of train.pq, this method could involve the following steps:|Causal Language Modeling is a technique used to train language models to predict the next word in a sequence, given the previous words. This method ensures that the model learns the structure and context of language in a way that mimics how humans read or generate text. In the context of train_full.pq, this approach involves:|
|Distillation: The process of training a smaller or more efficient model to mimic the behavior of a larger, more complex model. This smaller model is "distilled" from the larger one by training it on the outputs of the larger model, potentially improving efficiency and performance.|Autoregressive Modeling: The model predicts the next word in a sequence based on the previous words. This is typically done in a left-to-right fashion, meaning the model generates one word at a time, conditioned on all previous words.|
|Preference Optimization: Fine-tuning the model to optimize for certain preferences, which could be based on user feedback, predefined rules, or specific goals. This ensures that the model generates outputs that are more aligned with desired outcomes.|Causal Relationships: The model learns the causal relationships between words, phrases, and sentences. This helps in generating coherent and contextually appropriate text.|

### Application to the example files

|train.pq (DPO Modeling)|train_full.pq (Causal Language Modeling)|

|Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)|Open Assistant (OASST)|
|-|-|
|DPO is a technique used in machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning and recommendation systems, to optimize a model based on direct user preferences or feedback. Instead of relying solely on implicit signals or indirect metrics, DPO uses explicit user preferences to guide the training process. This can lead to more accurate and user-centric models, as the optimization process directly aligns with what users prefer or find valuable.|OASST is an open-source project aimed at creating a high-quality, free, and accessible conversational AI. The goal of OASST is to develop an assistant that can engage in natural, informative, and helpful conversations with users. By being open-source, OASST encourages collaboration and contributions from the global community, promoting transparency, innovation, and inclusivity in the development of conversational AI technologies.|

* Open Assistant (OASST) is broader in scope. It's an open-source project aimed at creating advanced conversational AI systems. These systems can involve various techniques and models, including but not limited to causal language modeling. The primary goal of OASST is to develop high-quality, open, and accessible conversational agents that can interact with users in natural and helpful ways.
So, while OASST might employ causal language modeling as one of its methods, it encompasses a wider range of technologies and goals aimed at building comprehensive conversational AI.
